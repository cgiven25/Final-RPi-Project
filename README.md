# Final-RPi-Project
This project is a weather app - something you can easily manage and view that keeps track of the day-to-day weather.

Some of the capabilities come from a Raspberry Pi model 3B+.  These include:
  Current temperature
  Humidity

The other information is found by polling two APIs:
  Dark Sky API (this app is powered by the Dark Sky: https://darksky.net/poweredby/)
  Openweathermap
  
  Openweathermap provided us with:
    Wind speed
    Wind Direction
    Descriptions of the weather
    Images to match descriptions
  
  Dark Sky provided us with:
    Chance of precipitation
    Temperature High and Low
